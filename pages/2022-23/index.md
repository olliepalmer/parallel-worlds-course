<h1>Parallel Worlds 2022-23</h1>

Welcome to Parallel Worlds course for the academic year 2022-23.

All of the module information, our in-class exercises, and resources are archived here for reference. Feel free to take any of the course content and use it for anything you like. Students' work, however, is their own.

Parallel Worlds is run as an in-person _intensive_ module this year for Situated Design MA students at the Master Institute of Visual Cultures, between 8-16 February 2023.
