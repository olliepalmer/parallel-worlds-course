# Course overview

World-building is a valuable tool in art and design. The ability to immerse an audience in a ‘complete world’ is crucial to the framing of movies and TV shows. What’s more, corporations, nations, political parties, theatrical productions, and futurists all engage in ‘world-building’. What can artists and designers learn from world-building to enhance, frame, and augment their own practice?

This Situated Design module encourages students to explore the possibilities of world-building in their own practice through a series of structured activities. The course is practice-led, using in-person individual and group activities to think about the way that elements of life and the experiences you have had can be woven together, merged with fantastical elements, and used to frame your existing practice. The course encourages students to build on skills they already have, enhancing their current practice and projects by creating worlds to embed them in.

We will be using philosopher Maurizio Ferraris’ concept of social objects to create artefacts, and imagined social and individual memories. We will use theory and techniques from numerous places – theatre, counterfactuals, psychological operations, fiction, television and film production, propaganda, situationism – as well as testing new methods for world-building. By the end of the course, students will have designed maquettes and small sets, artefacts from imagined worlds, presented and re-framed aspects of their own work, and produced a piece of work up to 10 minutes in length which frames a journey through their work.

This intensive course is methods-focused. We will make things throughout the course, and the assessment will focus on an experience that students design.

## Module aims

This course aims to provide a series of practicable methods that can be used within and around your current practice, to create perceived value around what you already do.

# Assessment

The final assessment takes place from 13.50-17.10 on Friday 16 Feb. The assessors are Dr. Ollie Palmer and Marton Kabai.

*Pass or fail*

- 5-10 minute presentation of an ‘experience’ which frames your work
- 3-5 minute explanation of the ‘experience’ (aims, methods, etc)
- Active participation in exercises, group discussions during classes


## Assessment criteria

Each student will present a 5-10 minute ‘experience’ for the assessors (and peers) which frames their creative practice through a ‘journey’ (this could be a physical installation, a theatrical performance, a video, an audio work, etc).

Each student will also present a 3-5 minute description of their ‘journey’; what their intentions are, and how this frames their creative practice.

All students are expected to be present for each others’ presentations.

1. Experience: 60% of total grade. To be presented in a format chosen by the student (e.g. video, performance, curated experience, audio installation, etc).

A well worked out experience comprises the following:

- The student creates an innovative experience which frames their intended mode of practice in the future, taking into account the ways in which an audience might hear about, experience, and reflect on their work.
- The experience reflects the students’ overall artistic and creative aims, folding the methods and positioning developed through this course into their work.
- The student has selected appropriate methods and media for creating and presenting their work.

2. Reflection on experience: 20% of final grade. This is given via oral presentation, before or after the examiners have seen the 'experience'.

A well worked out reflection comprises the following:

- The student is able to clearly articulate and explain the positioning they are presenting, the methods they have selected, and the rationale behind their choices.
- The student shows an iterative working / thinking process that takes into account both their own intentions and the way in which these are framed for an audience.

3. Participation in course: 20% of final grade.

A good participation grade comprises the following:

- The student is an active participant in group conversations and exercises.
- The student is supportive of peers, offering feedback that enables other students to grow.


### Grading process

The student will be judged on each criteria, with points from 1 to 10. The combined value of these grades will determine the final grade; a 5.5 or above is a pass. The student will be given a PASS or FAIL in Osiris.


| Elements | Weights | Maximum points to be obtained (score times 10) |
|----------|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | 6       | 60                                             |
| 2        | 2       | 20                                             |
| 3        | 2       | 20                                             |
| Total    | 10      | 100                                            |

Overall, this adds up to:

| Grade | Quality                | Pass/fail |
|-------|------------------------|-----------|
| 10    | Outstanding            | Pass      |
| 9     | Very good              | Pass      |
| 8     | Good                   | Pass      |
| 7     | More than satisfactory | Pass      |
| 6     | Satisfactory           | Pass      |
| 5     | Almost satisfactory    | Fail      |
| 4     | Unsatisfactory         | Fail      |
| 3     | Very unsatisfactory    | Fail      |
| 2     | Poor                   | Fail      |
| 1     | Very poor              | Fail      |


In addition to the above grades, the following results can be registered in Osiris:  
Not present (NP), if you registered for the test but did not take part in the test. The registration counts as a used test opportunity.
Ungradable (UG), if your test could not be graded because you did not meet the requirements (for example formatting requirements or attendance requirement). This also counts as a used test opportunity.
Exemption (EX), if the Examination Board has granted an exemption from a test.  

### Resits  

Students have the right to one further attempt to pass an exam in the same academic year. Resits are scheduled to take 5 weeks after the first assessment. Tutors must write a specific assignment in the grade center Osiris to be carried out and ready for examination by the resit date. Students must be notified of the assignment (at the latest) 7 days after the examination taking place.

## Inclusion

This course is designed to further your creativity and allow you to explore new ideas, techniques, and concepts. In order to do this, we have a collective responsibility as a class to make sure that everybody feels able to express themselves in a safe environment. It is critical that we are able to show respect for all world-views and perspectives expressed in class.

At The Master Institute of Visual Cultures we embrace an atmosphere of creativity which is enriched and enhanced by diversity along a number of dimensions, including race, ethnicity and national origins, gender and gender identity, sexuality, class, and religion. The school is especially committed to increasing the representation of those populations which have historically been excluded from participation in Dutch higher education.

If you have a name or pronoun which differs from the one we have on record, please me know.

If you feel that something said or done in class is troubling or has caused discomfort, please contact me confidentially. Like many people, I am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities, and am always eager to hear from students how I can improve in this respect.

If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please speak to me, or contact the Renaat Casier, MIVC’s student counsellor. You can make an appointment by calling the Student Information Desk at +31 88 - 525 75 50. You can also find out more information about Avans student services at [studentinfo.avans.nl/international](https://studentinfo.avans.nl/international).
