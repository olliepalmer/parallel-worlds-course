# 2021 Week 7 Episode 5: Parallel Perspectives, Food for the Soul by Vlad
{: .no_toc}


_We focus on food and its relation with art_

Note: Hello and welcome to Parallel Worlds!

Just a quick note about the Reflection Week recordings this week. They were all produced in class by students on the Parallel Worlds course, who interviewed each other about some work they’d made during the course.

For most of the students it’s the first time they’ve recorded and published audio work, and of course the best way to learn how to do it is just getting on with it: having a task to do, and performing that task to the best of your abilities. The reason we’ve published them on the podcast feed is so that everyone can listen to each others’ work and provide productive feedback on how to improve the recording, scripting, interview techniques, and audio production that will be crucial to their final projects. Enjoy these peer-to-peer interviews.

Hello and welcome to Parallel Worlds!

Just a quick note about the Reflection Week recordings this week. They were all produced in class by students on the Parallel Worlds course, who interviewed each other about some work they’d made during the course.

For most of the students it’s the first time they’ve recorded and published audio work, and of course the best way to learn how to do it is just getting on with it: having a task to do, and performing that task to the best of your abilities. The reason we’ve published them on the podcast feed is so that everyone can listen to each others’ work and provide productive feedback on how to improve the recording, scripting, interview techniques, and audio production that will be crucial to their final projects.

Vlad:

hello there. Welcome everybody on today's episode of a parallel perspectives, our guest is a naked doormat. She's the photographer and also graphic designer studying at the same juice to Academy of arts. Her art focuses mainly on social and political issues, but also does into ecology. And importance of the future.
Welcome.

Niké:

Thank you. Let so, so happy to be here and thank you for such a dense introduction. I, yeah, it's always hard to describe to describe yourself, but, um, yeah, I really liked that the way you described me. Thank you so much.

Vlad:

All right. In today's episode, I wanted you to ask, uh, what role does food play in your life?
Are you passionate about it or you just see it as a way of surviving?

Niké:

Ah, that's a nice question. Well, I'm actually super passionate about it. Um, I have been, uh, cooking everyday since, I don't know. I think I was 16. My mom, she always was really good cook. She still is. And, um, when I left my, uh, my home, when I was 17, I was suddenly all alone.
And I called my mom and said, what do I eat tonight? And she taught me a really basic, um, onion, pasta dish. And since then, uh, I've been cooking ever since and, uh, developing many recipes and, uh, discovering new tastes. Um, So, yeah, I love food. I wouldn't say it as a necessary evil or as a, uh, I don't know, uh, something like that at all.
I think it's one of the most enjoyable moments of the day and I'm happy that I get to do it three times a day.

Vlad:

That sounds amazing. Uh, on onion with pasta, you gotta send me the recipe.

Niké:

Yeah, I will. Okay.

Vlad:

So, um, there is this a very legendary quote that, uh, art is food for the soul. Would you agree with that? And, uh, if yes, how is that, uh, apply to you?

Niké:

Um, yes, I think I would agree, um, For example, I know a lot of people who don't work in art, I think the majority of my friends is like, I don't know an accountant or a doctor or a, all those things that don't have anything to do with art.
And I sense that in the beginning, when I talk about things that I'm learning at school, they're always a bit sort of skeptical or hesitant. But then when I take them to a museum or show them pictures or movies, they're always super interested. And I sense that they. Then also start reflecting about their own life.
Like, okay, I'm working at Proctor and gamble every day. It's this now life. And he gives to us photos for her as a job. And what am I doing with my life? So I think. That art in all levels of, of humanity is definitely food for the, for this whole one really needed to, I dunno, revive, uh, once imagination and creativity.
And, um, I think it can open up so many different discussions, um, because it's so versatile and there are so many mediums. Uh, so yeah, I would definitely agree. What a

Vlad:

beautiful answer. Thank you for telling me your perspective on it. And if, uh, based on this quote, if your art or your practice would be a dish, what dish would it be?

Niké:

Ooh, tough one. Um, well considering that my, my photos are always very rich in color and have a lot of contrast. Um, I would choose, I think, uh, dish, which is full of vegetables and different textures, sort of, um, seeing them as contrast. Um, and I would also say fresh because I always have a lot of plants, water skies.
Pictures in my photos. So I would say

Vlad:

interesting choice of this. Well, can I see the rings? It's a Friday tonight. Do you have any special dinner plans? How is, how is your Friday dinner looking?

Niké:

Um, well, mostly I am the one who cooks, so it's always me. Uh, having to do the groceries, having to make up for this. Um, and it's not because my boyfriend don't doesn't want to, but I think I instinctively just take over control in the kitchen, which is something that I want to unlearn because I feel really spoiled when someone else cooks, even though the dish is very mediocre.
I always enjoy someone else's food who so much more than when I, uh, when I made it myself. So I'm hoping that when I come home, which will be around, I don't know, six or seven dead, my boyfriend has made a dish, which will probably be, I don't know. I think it will be like a burger, which was due for today.
Like the expiration date was today, maybe some potatoes and some steamed broccoli. And my boyfriend said that he was really fencing a bear. So I think we're going to have a lot of cold bears. Yeah,

Vlad:

nice beers and burgers sounds like an amazing Friday evening plan. Okay. Me Kim. Thank you so much for the interview.
Um, it was amazing. Hear a bit more about to you and your practice and, uh, hopefully we'll see everybody soon and normal times.

Niké:

Yes. Thank you so much for that. Thank you.
