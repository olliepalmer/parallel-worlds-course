## Transcript
Hi, and welcome to the fifth of the Parallel Worlds podcasts with exercises for you to do at home. Today, we're going to be doing the same thing that we've done for the last four days, and that is to do two free writes. Now, thematically, these free writes are leading towards the lecture that we have this week, the longer podcast that will talk about the idea of counterfactuals. But first, before we get to that point, I would like you to do the free write again, and take another five minutes right now to reflect on your daily life. Remember, remove all distractions from around you, get your pen and paper or your keypad and notebook or whatever it is that you use to take notes down at the ready, and five minutes of free writing about your daily life reflecting on what's going on around you right now. Go.

[5 minutes]

Okay, any changes since yesterday? Any changes since day one or day two or day three? Anything that you're seeing differently? Any ways that you're remapping the space in your own mind about things that exist around you that you see every day? I am genuinely curious to hear what your reflections are on this.

So without much further ado, I would like you to do the second of the free writing exercises today. This one is a very simple one. It's similar to the ones that we did yesterday. But I would like you to write about a change that could have been made that would change the present. So if you could go back in time and change something, what would that thing be? Now this can be a fictional scenario or it can be something that you really regret or something that you really enjoyed but you could find a way to enjoy it more. So I would like you to write about a change that you could have made and I would like you to write for five minutes starting now.

[5 minutes]

That's it. That's your time. How was the writing writing? Did it go well? Did you find yourself exploring a completely weird alternative universe? Did you find yourself writing about things that you never thought you would have written about? Let me know how it went. Find the voicemail link in the description and you can just talk for a couple of seconds about what you wrote about. I am really curious to see what people have been working on thinking about what they've been doing. And that's it for this week for the exercises.

The next podcast to come out will be one that is for you to consume in your own time. And that is a podcast on the subject of counterfactuals that is in advance of the class that we have if you are a master student at AKV St. Joost. But if you're not, just listen to it, get some ideas and enjoy. Goodbye.

## Exercises

Two 5-minute free-writing exercises. Write on a blank piece of paper, in whatever language you feel most comfortable with, on the subjects of:

- Your daily life
- A change that would have made a difference
