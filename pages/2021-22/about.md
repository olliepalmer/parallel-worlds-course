# Course overview


World-building is a valuable tool in art and design. The ability to immerse an audience in a complete world is crucial to the framing of TV shows and movies; corporations, nations, political parties, theatrical productions, and futurists all engage in ‘world-building’. What can artists and designers learn from world-building to enhance and augment their own practice?

This elective module encourages students to explore the possibilities of world-building in their own practice through a series of structured activities. The course is practice-led, and taught via a series of open-access podcasts, and classes, we will gather to discuss ideas and work. The course encourages students to build on skills they already have, enhancing their current practice and projects by creating worlds to embed them in.

We will be using philosopher Maurizio Ferraris’ concept of [social objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentality) to create artefacts, and imagined social and individual memories. We will use theory and techniques from numerous places – theatre, [counterfactuals](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/counterfactuals/), [psychological operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_operations_(United_States)), fiction, television and film production, propaganda, [situationism](https://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/situ.html) – as well as testing new methods for world-building. By the end of the course, students will have designed maquettes and small sets, artefacts from imagined worlds, presented and re-framed aspects of their own work, and produced a short audio production which blends their everyday practice or life with a fantastical version of it. The course is methods-focused, but will also provide supplementary reading materials for students who wish to integrate these methods into their practice.

Please note that the scope of the course, the mode of teaching, and the expected outputs have changed since the beginning of the course in reaction to the global COVID-19 crisis. [MIVC](https://www.akvstjoostmasters.nl/) is based in the Netherlands, and our school's building has been closed since mid-March 2020. The upside of this is that the mode of disseminating our work has become a [podcast](/podcast), which anyone in the world can listen to for free, and where we will disseminate our students' work at the end of the course.

The course will be performed in public: the syllabus and assignments will be made open access at [parallel.olliepalmer.com](https://parallel.olliepalmer.com), as well as in the [course podcast](/podcast) – which is where students from MIVC will share their work at the end of the course.

# Course guidelines

## Teaching and participation

A new podcast episode, with 15-20 minutes' writing and world-building exercises, is released every weekday during term-time. A longer podcast is released once a week, with issues that will be discussed in class.


**Please note there are changes due to the coronavirus crisis**

The total time allocated for a 3EC course is 84 hours. This means that in addition to attending classes, you are also expected to carry out around 4-5 hours’ work on your assignments outside of class time.

The class is taught primarily via [podcast](/podcast), which enables you to work in your own time. We also meet online once a week on Fridays between 13:50-17:15 CET (check with your time zone [here](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?pl=1&lid=2759794&h=2759794)). These classes are a place to discuss the work you've done this week, set collective agendas and goals, and have tutorials. In normal circumstances, failure to attend 2 classes or the assessment at the end of the course is grounds for failing the course (with the exception of emergencies). However, since shifting to online tuition for this course, I realise that not everyone has equal access to technology, bandwidth, and may have other commitments. Consequently, no penalty will be imposed if you can't attend classes. Please do let me know if you need extra tuition or help – just email [om.palmer@avans.nl](mailto:om.palmer@avans.nl).

There will be activities, conversations, presentations, feedback, and group work in class. Please try to engage with these activities as fully as possible. If for any reason you feel uncomfortable with any of these activities please let your tutor know.

## Marking

You will be graded on three elements:

### Narrative audio work

Narrative audio work: 60% of final grade

- Make a narrative audio work of 5-12 minutes’ length which includes elements of:
  - your real, daily life and/or artistic practice
  - a parallel, fictional world of your choosing
- The role of this exercise is to enact the learnings of this course – the process of world-building and narrative writing – in one concise audio work.
- The audio work can be real and/or fictionalised. It can use autobiography, fiction, found sounds, your own foley – whatever helps you to take the listener on a journey between two worlds.
- It should carefully consider the emotional journey you wish for a listener to go through, using principles of ‘framing’ we have discussed in class.

### Overview of process

Overview of process to reach narrative audio work: 20% of final grade

- This work should help an audience ‘frame’ your work more.
- Present a 2-4 minute overview of the narrative audio work, in audio/visual format. This can be a presentation, a pre-recorded video or audio file, a PDF, or another format of your choosing.
- The role of this activity is to enable you to describe your process, and the work that you have put into your narrative audio work. It lets you add value to the work you have submitted through explanation of the elements which might otherwise be hidden
- You can play elements of your narrative audio work and describe what they are and how they are made, or your thought process
- This overview could be presented in several different ways, depending on your own preference, for example:
  - An introduction to the work, like curators’ introductions to a gallery show
  - A ‘behind the scenes’ expose of your working process
  - A series of working notes
  - Footnotes to subjects or themes in your work
  - Et cetera
- Use this presentation to _add value to the narrative audio work_, highlighting elements that you want listeners to hear.


### Overview of creative processes

Overview of creative processes from the course: 20% of final grade

- Choose a small selection of the exercises you have completed in class, or through the class podcast. Present the exercises, and what you personally learnt from them, as if you are presenting to an audience who have never heard of them before.
- The presentation should be 2-4 minutes long, and can use any audiovisual media you see fit, e.g. a presentation, a pre-recorded video or audio file, a PDF, or another format of your choosing.
- This assessment allows you to demonstrate your understanding of activities within the course, and provides a place to reflect on your own personal practice.


<!-- ## Assessment procedure

To be announced
 -->
<!-- The course assessment is on Friday 29 May, with award-winning writer, film-maker and audio producer [Ross Sutherland](https://www.imaginaryadvice.com/) as external examiner, and [Ollie Palmer](https://olliepalmer.com) as internal examiner.

You will be sent a Zoom link via email. Please download Zoom in advance and familiarise yourself with how to present a slideshow.

Because video calls can be exhausting, the day will be split into four 40-60 minute presentation sessions. You are only expected to be present for the session you're in, but you're welcome to join us for the other sessions. Students are also encouraged to ask their colleagues questions about their work and methods.

You have up to 10 minutes to present your work (see above), and up to 10 minutes for questions and answers. The examiners will have listened to your work in advance, but might play an excerpt of your work to discuss. You can also play extracts if it helps your presentation. -->

<!-- ### Deadlines

- You must upload your narrative audio file [here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/Zs1Ssvo20cPPnvA26SPU) by **Tuesday 26 May 23:00 CEST**.
- The file must be in ```.mp3```, ```.mp4```, or ```.wav``` format.
- The file should be named ```yourname_audio-title.extension``` (so a story called 'now and then' made by Ollie Palmer would be ```olliepalmer_now-and-then.mp3```)

- You must upload your presentations [here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/xGvpPiBYiExLe1R7LK2k) by **Thursday 28 May 23:00 CEST**.
- You can upload in ```PDF``` format, or ```PowerPoint```/```Keynote```.

**[Upload audio work here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/Zs1Ssvo20cPPnvA26SPU)** / **[Upload presentations here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/xGvpPiBYiExLe1R7LK2k)** -->
