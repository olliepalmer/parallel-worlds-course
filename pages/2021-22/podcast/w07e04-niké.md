# 2021 Week 7 Episode 4: Parallel Perspectives by Niké
{: .no_toc}


_We focus on food and its relation with art_

Note: Hello and welcome to Parallel Worlds!

Just a quick note about the Reflection Week recordings this week. They were all produced in class by students on the Parallel Worlds course, who interviewed each other about some work they’d made during the course.

For most of the students it’s the first time they’ve recorded and published audio work, and of course the best way to learn how to do it is just getting on with it: having a task to do, and performing that task to the best of your abilities. The reason we’ve published them on the podcast feed is so that everyone can listen to each others’ work and provide productive feedback on how to improve the recording, scripting, interview techniques, and audio production that will be crucial to their final projects. Enjoy these peer-to-peer interviews.

Introduction

Hello and welcome to Parallel Worlds!

Just a quick note about the Reflection Week recordings this week. They were all produced in class by students on the Parallel Worlds course, who interviewed each other about some work they’d made during the course.

For most of the students it’s the first time they’ve recorded and published audio work, and of course the best way to learn how to do it is just getting on with it: having a task to do, and performing that task to the best of your abilities.

Well, good night, everyone at Parallel Perspectives Podcast . Today's guest is Vladimir Mihalache. And he is a Romanian artist filmmaker who is currently residing in Tilburg and is doing his masters at St. Joost Academy in Den Bosch. We're very excited to have him here. Welcome Vlad.

Vlad:

Thank you so much for the introduction, Niké That's very nice. First of all, how are you doing? I can see you are at the Academy right now. I, you busy in the studio.

Niké:

Yeah, I'm in the studio. There is no one here, so it's actually quite nice and calm. So we have all this space to record this session easily. Um, the weather is nice and I heard that Ollie is also in the buildings, but, um, I haven't gotten the chance to, to say hi to him yet to our virtual Ollie.
And how are you doing? Where are you?

Vlad:

I am at home right now. Yeah. Which I'm kind of treating it like my own personal studio, because, uh, with the, with the current situation going everywhere, I'm trying to limit traveling as much as I can, which is being socially responsible, but I'm good. I really haven't let myself be affected by the situation I continued with too.
My research trips and my personal projects. So I'm really glad, uh, as you said, that things slowed down for a second. Ah,

Niké:

that's so good to hear. And when you said research trips, can you, can you say a bit more about that? Oh yeah. For

Vlad:

example, like I enjoy going to places that are usually very busy and very unaccessible.
Because of the exaggerated tourist population and, uh, yeah, it's very nice to travel and explore during the, during this current times.

Niké:

Okay. And what sort of things do you capture then? Do you make films or do you make photos of

Vlad:

people. Oh, I take, I take like landscape photography of, uh, depending on, on the place, but at the moment I'm working on futuristic architecture and what was the inspiration for it, but, uh, yeah,

Niké:

sounds awesome.

Vlad:

I really haven't, uh, I haven't felt this this year.

Niké:

I wanted to make a bridge, but I don't know how to make one. I wanted to continue a bit. Yes. Um, well, before continuing with the main topic, um, I wanted to introduce you a bit. It is food, and I was wondering what role does food play in your life? Are you passionate about it or do you see it as a necessary evil?

Vlad:

Uh, I really liked this a necessary evil no, of course, I think food plays a very big role in everybody's life and it depends on each culture, how they preserve this relationship with food. For example, maybe when we were kids, we would avoid healthy vegetables or, you know, just like any kids, a be crazily into candies or snacks or McDonald's.
But now as I grow older, I realized how important these two to have vegetables grown in the local area. Yeah. It definitely plays a major role in my life.

Niké:

Nice.

Vlad:

Um, recently I'm trying to be more conscious about it and to, yeah. Uh, choose wisely before going on a, on a shopping round, but, uh, of course temptations are at, every corner.

Niké:

Oh, what sort of sensation do you get alerting to?

Vlad:

Uh, depending on the situation like, uh, recently I started to enjoy, uh, natural crisps with, uh, with deep being passionate about films and always having that popcorn kind of snack nachos, actually I realized are the best film choice.

Niké:

Warm nachos with, like, cheese sauce, or guacamole?

Vlad:

I actually am going for the, for the red one, right?
The spicy one. Right.

Niké:

I heard someone say art is food for the soul quote. I don't know. But would you agree? And can you elaborate a bit more about that?

Vlad:

Yes. Very, very nice art food for the soul. That's because, uh, all right. Plays a necessary part in everybody's life. Even if some people decides to ignore it or even go against art, they don't realize that art is at the very core of humanity.
We are born from love and art is the mix of human perspective and appreciation of the place. That's you are situated in. So yes, of course. All right. Being a part of my everyday life, I do considering food for the soul.

Niké:

That's such a lovely answer. Um, well, we have to wrap up soon, but I have two more questions that I really want to ask you.
And that is if your art would be a dish, what would it be?


Vlad:

That if I would be to consider my, my art dish, it would probably be something European Eastern European, but with Western influences, for example, like a meatball spaghetti or pizza with a burger slices on top sounds lovely. Well, we really have to wrap up because the podcast is almost done it's Friday, today.


Niké:

And do you have any special dinner plans and what are you going to eat?

Vlad:

You have been the, you know, beginning of the weekend. I always try to do something special at the beginning to make sure I haven't wasted the next few days. So I'm planning a dinner with my neighbor and the. We were thinking what traditional food to test this weekend.
So we decided we'd do a big Mexican party. So we're going to have a vegetarian burrito's and, um, the nachos I was talking about third year. Definitely.

Niké:

That sounds amazing. Well, if not, I want to thank you so much for joining today.

Vlad:

Yeah. Um, and I hope thank you, Niké, for taking the time to find a bit about what is going on with me right now.

Niké:

Yeah. My pleasure have fun tonight and enjoy your vegetarian burritos.

Vlad:

Thank you.

Niké:

Thank you. Bye.
