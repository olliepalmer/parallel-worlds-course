# 2021 Week 7 Episode 5: Parallel Perspectives, Food for the Soul by Vlad
{: .no_toc}


_We focus on food and its relation with art_

Note: Hello and welcome to Parallel Worlds!

Just a quick note about the Reflection Week recordings this week. They were all produced in class by students on the Parallel Worlds course, who interviewed each other about some work they’d made during the course.

For most of the students it’s the first time they’ve recorded and published audio work, and of course the best way to learn how to do it is just getting on with it: having a task to do, and performing that task to the best of your abilities. The reason we’ve published them on the podcast feed is so that everyone can listen to each others’ work and provide productive feedback on how to improve the recording, scripting, interview techniques, and audio production that will be crucial to their final projects. Enjoy these peer-to-peer interviews.

Introduction

Hello and welcome to Parallel Worlds!

Just a quick note about the Reflection Week recordings this week. They were all produced in class by students on the Parallel Worlds course, who interviewed each other about some work they’d made during the course.

For most of the students it’s the first time they’ve recorded and published audio work, and of course the best way to learn how to do it is just getting on with it: having a task to do, and performing that task to the best of your abilities. The reason we’ve published them on the podcast feed is so that everyone can listen to each others’ work and provide productive feedback on how to improve the recording, scripting, interview techniques, and audio production that will be crucial to their final projects. Enjoy these peer-to-peer interviews.

Elisabet: Hello and welcome to our podcast. Welcome. We'll have a thank you for coming today. Uh, we're really pleased to have you here and today we're going to talk about your work, but first I want you to tell a little bit about yourself. Hi, thanks for having me. I'm really excited about our recent project we worked on, but first let me introduce myself to our listener.

Mohammad: My name is Mohammed Abou Chair. I'm the senior graphic designer and doing my masters study. To learn more about filmmaking and story narratives in order to create my own film, to tell different people, life stories. Uh, maybe we can, uh, hear some of the recordings right now.

Elisabet: Yes, let's uh, press play and you can hear it

Mohammad: Last night, I went to this really nice bar by myself. I never saw it before, while passing by the street every day. So I thought to myself, I can go in and have a drink, maybe two .As they went inside to the cozy, warm space .I was really surprised it was empty. I asked the, took on the boy to pour me a drink. Suddenly and out of nowhere, I asked the chick, why a bartender?

(chicken clucking noise)

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, let me translate this for you.

"As you know, chickens cannot fly. So we had to adapt to this modern society where I choose to be a bartender," said the chick. The chick kept telling me about her struggles, how other birds are racist to them because they can not fly. The check told me it all started when chick the first wanted to have a flying license, but the chick the first was lazy to study or even to fly.

That's when the department of flying birds or as they call it, the F B agreed not to give the chick her license and all the chicks were doomed to stay and they ground for the rest of their lives.

Elisabet: Yeah. So please tell me about, uh, your story.

Mohammad: Okay. So at first we had this desk to create a list of lies  that we would tell to kids, you know, and one of the lies that came to my mind was chickens don't fly. Why? Because they didn't pass the flying test exam because like a normal people, uh, we would go to do a driving test, examine, drive a car and doing a test, uh, about, uh, how the car works, what are the rules of the road, blah, blah, blah. So I imagine maybe the chickens or birds has the same things maybe.

And, uh, I was wondering how, what would look like if, uh, if I walked into a bar and I was a, at the bartender was a chick, but I'm not going to tell the people that the bartender there is a chick actually. So I tried to use the word chick as, so we can it sounded like a girl and the chicken at the same time. And from there, I started to write this narrative about how I was walking into a bar and they saw a chick, but the chick was an actual, not an actual chick, but the chicken, and having a conversation with the chick and ask, how did that all happen? Like, why aren't you flying, you know, and in a way to hear a story from different perspective and adding more suspense to the story by editing my own voice and using different sounds in the background.

Elisabet: Yeah, I think it's a great story we'll have here. And I'm very curious about like, uh, what inspired you to come up with this story?

Mohammad: Well I don't know, I like to make, uh, make weird stuff out of my mind. I have those weird ideas, my imagination that I like to. playwith sometimes. And I had like a lot of lies on my list. Maybe I have some in front of me, so I have like a, a cup that never gets empty, a door that does not open or it opens, but it doesn't take you anywhere, a wallet that generates money when you do a good deed, a Hoover made out of ant colony, for example, like I was thinking about that as well to make it as a sound recording . Yeah. I prefer to have the funny chick story.

Elisabet: Yeah, this is great. And, um, I am very curious about like your process, uh, here, like. Um, can you tell more about that?

Mohammad: Ok, so first I wrote the story, then I started recording and, uh, I recorded everything. I already imagined how it's going to be in my head. Uh, I used the background, the music from the internet I found for free. And then I used, uh, I made up this chicken sound, uh, to make it sound weird.


And then I edited it a little bit on Adobe audition, audition. Um, yeah, that's pretty much it, it was not, it was like a fast, uh, on the moment, uh, kind of work.

Elisabet: Yeah. Thank you so much for your, uh, Um, time and that you are sharing your work with us, and I'm very happy to have you here and good luck. And thank you for having you here.

Mohammad: Well, thank you for having me. Uh, it was really fun to be here and it was a nice conversation. Thank you.
