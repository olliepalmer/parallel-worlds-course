# 2021 Week 7 Episode 3: Tracks by Linda
{: .no_toc}


_Joris describes a sound exploration along the train tracks and the joy of listening with new ears._

Note: Hello and welcome to Parallel Worlds!

Just a quick note about the Reflection Week recordings this week. They were all produced in class by students on the Parallel Worlds course, who interviewed each other about some work they’d made during the course.

For most of the students it’s the first time they’ve recorded and published audio work, and of course the best way to learn how to do it is just getting on with it: having a task to do, and performing that task to the best of your abilities. The reason we’ve published them on the podcast feed is so that everyone can listen to each others’ work and provide productive feedback on how to improve the recording, scripting, interview techniques, and audio production that will be crucial to their final projects. Enjoy these peer-to-peer interviews.

Hello and welcome to Parallel Worlds!

Just a quick note about the Reflection Week recordings this week. They were all produced in class by students on the Parallel Worlds course, who interviewed each other about some work they’d made during the course.

For most of the students it’s the first time they’ve recorded and published audio work, and of course the best way to learn how to do it is just getting on with it: having a task to do, and performing that task to the best of your abilities. The reason we’ve published them on the podcast feed is so that everyone can listen to each others’ work and provide productive feedback on how to improve the recording, scripting, interview techniques, and audio production that will be crucial to their final projects.

Linda:

Dear listeners and welcome to this week's podcast, where we will be talking with your slip bone and he will tell us all about his adventures in the Albert Hein and near the train tracks. It's entirely possible that after listening, you won't experience those places in the same way ever again.

So you told me you recorded some weekends paint. Tell me a little bit more about it and why did you choose those sounds?

Joris:

Yeah, I made a kind of awalk, a sound walk yesterday and I started recording various sounds. When you actually like looking for sounds you much more than you usually do. Yeah. It was really fun as well.

When you hear the real world, you can already like, imagine the story next to, to the sound you hear, like travel or another journey. Um, I went to the supermarket as well. The checkout, I was just standing there with my phone and you're here, the notice difficult noises from the overtime, you know, when they scan the products and bird sounds as well

Linda:

Which sound surprised you the most?

Joris:

I think the, the, the train recoding was really good because you could hear it coming from a distance, but it still took like half a minute. And then it does really. There's buildup and then like really intense noise and then the slowing down. And, uh, yeah, I was quite surprised how good the quality was.

Linda:

Did you, uh, encounter any problems while recording the sounds?

Joris:

No, no, but I, I did think about it, especially near the railroad. Like maybe people think I'm a crazy person standing there and so it's a bit, uh, worrisome that some people might think, uh, I'm gonna run in front of the train, but for the rest of the, uh, the supermarket, you can just do it like, uh .

Linda:

Yeah that's uh, the big, uh, pro of recording sound. That is a little bit less in your face than video.

Joris:

I think like the, the coolest sounds there's if you're in a place where people think what's this guy doing, you know, but sometimes you have to, to go out and get the goods. Recording, you know, it's the trial. I enjoyed it.
It was to go out and record stuff. You know, you get a more open attitude, I think to sense different things.
