## Transcript

Hi, this is Ollie, the voice you’ve been hearing throughout this Parallel Worlds podcast. This episode is an apology, and a brief update. It probably shows up on your feed as a bonus episode, but to be honest, it’s not that much of a bonus.

Firstly, the apology.

If you’ve been following this course in real-time, I’m sorry I haven’t uploaded any new episodes for a while. It takes a good chunk of time to write and produce each episode, and in the past few weeks, time is the thing I’ve been lacking the most. So I am sorry about this, and I will rectify it when I can.

The second part of this episode is a brief update, on the course, and the podcast itself.

The course that this podcast is part of – the elective module Parallel Worlds at the Master Institute of Visual Cultures St Joost – has finished. All of the students made an audio work; they all submitted their projects; they've all been graded. They did a great job, and I feel lucky to get to work with such lovely and creative people.

But this podcast is unresolved. It’s been sitting on Week 5 Episode 2 for a while.

So here is the plan:

There are three or four podcast episodes to come which take you through the exercises we – at the school – did in-class to generate an audio story. They’re just scripts on my computer now, but as soon as I get a chance, I will turn them into episodes.

The big project that our students worked on was an audio story which ties their real life and practice, in the present, with something fantastical, a parallel world of some kind. The episodes that are coming soon help you to do exactly this, building on skills you’ve already worked on in this course. A word of warning about this part though. This is the bit where we go from timed exercises into untimed, free-form content creation. You'll have to become your own proofreader, editor, and producer. Everyone learns at different rates, and we all find different things easy and hard, so I can’t tell you how long this project will take. But hopefully, you’ll enjoy the exercises, and produce something you are proud of.

So that’s the exercises. Then there are two more episodes with people whose work I find interesting, and that are relevant to this course. I talked about world-building, writing, creativity and generosity with [Tim Clare](http://www.timclarepoet.co.uk) and [Abi Palmer](https://abipalmer.squarespace.com) – both of whom have a lot to say. These interviews will come out after the exercise episodes.

Then, the work of the students from the course here at MIVC will be put onto this podcast, so you can enjoy their work. As an educator, I am very keen on performing work, and helping students to put their work out into the wider world – so here, the platform we used to learn, will become the one to disseminate their projects. I’ve heard and enjoyed the stories they've produced and I can’t wait to share them with you.

And finally, there’s the question of this podcast itself, and its future. What’s it going to turn into once this course is over? I’ve really enjoyed putting this whole thing together, and working in a new medium. I hope you’ve enjoyed listening to it. I’d like to continue it in some form, whatever that might be.

Later this year, there’s another course I run called Scripted Design Processes, which I’ll probably convert to a podcast, and put out on this channel. In the meantime, let’s see where it goes. I am open to ideas, if you want to provide feedback, please do leave a voice message – as ever, there’s a link in the show notes.

Lastly, thanks for listening to this. I hope you are well and safe. I will be back soon – as soon as I can be.

Take care.
